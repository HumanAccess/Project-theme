# Project Theme 1.5 Beta update

I've changed the name to Beta to ensure it's status as such is clear and I'm in the process of re-Sassifying everything so the changes in some areas are significant. The styles all still work the same way, just the way they're put together has changed. 

- Updated to include Sass variables for nearly all property styles in _style-variables.scss.  
- The custom properties Sass variables have all been moved to _property-variables.scss.
- SVG icons are now included as Sass variables with maps now generating the properties and class utilities.
- Utilities for background colors with text and icons colors to suit, accordions and cards now integrate these.
- Spacing utilities extended to include margin and padding using (new) Sass variables and maps for sizing.
- Basic flex, block and percentage width utilities.
